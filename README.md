# WindowShark

WindowShark is a Windows Keylogger application. 

** This is a basic Keylogger that I programmed on my university days (old times). **

** I'm not responsible for what you use this to accomplish and should only be used for education purposes. **

# Setup

In order to setup the Keylogger, you will need a basic knowledge of C# language.

1. Open WindowShark.sln with Visual Studio.
2. Edit Program.cs with an email and password.
3. Compile the program.
4. Apply some kind of obfuscation.

# How it works?

Initially, when the user is infected with this malware, the malware will hide itself in a temporal folder. Also, will be added to the startup processes.

All the pressed keyboard buttons will be recorded and sended every XX minutes.

# Features

* The malware hide itself on temporal folders.
* The malware startups within the system.
* All the keyboard buttons pressed will be recorded.
* All the keyboard buttons pressed will be sended.

# TODO

This is a basic malware just for education.

A lot of improvements can be done.
